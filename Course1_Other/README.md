# Course 1 - Assigments

## Week2

### Python Basics with Numpy (optional assignment)

Welcome to your first assignment. This exercise gives you a brief introduction to Python. Even if you've used Python before, this will help familiarize you with functions we'll need.

Instructions:

     You will be using Python 3.
     Avoid using for-loops and while-loops, unless you are explicitly told to do so.
     Do not modify the (# GRADED FUNCTION [function name]) comment in some cells. Your
    work would not be graded if you change this. Each cell containing that comment should
    only contain one function.
     After coding your function, run the cell right below it to check if your result is correct.

After this assignment you will:

     Be able to use iPython Notebooks
     Be able to use numpy functions and numpy matrix/vector operations
     Understand the concept of "broadcasting"
     Be able to vectorize code

## Week3

### Planar data classification with one hidden layer

Welcome to your week 3 programming assignment. It's time to build your first neural network, which will have a hidden layer. You will see a big difference between this model and the one you implemented using logistic regression.

You will learn how to:

     Implement a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer
     Use units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh
     Compute the cross entropy loss
     Implement forward and backward propagation
